To add multiple Teachers to one door:

1. log in as the admin
2. On the right side there is a panel to create a teacher/user. Enter the number of the door (e.g. 601) that you will be creating a username and password for. Then select the room type option.
3. Click Make Teacher(s) - if you created 601 and had the tab as double, User 601a and 601b is created both with password 601.

Be sure to check to see if the room is already created by scrolling down past the media in game tab. You can close that tab if it becomes long by clicking on the "Media" tab. Delete the teacher601 if you want two teachers to exist on that door (i.e. teacher601a and teacher601b)
Once you scrolled down you can see which teachers exist via the Delete Users or the currentUrls tab.
