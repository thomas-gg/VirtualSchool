To add multiple Teachers to one door:

1. log in as the admin
2. On the right side there is a panel to create a teacher/user. Enter the number of the door (e.g. 601) that you will be creating a username and password for. Then select the room type option.
3. Click Make Teacher(s) - if you created 601 and had the tab as double, User 601a and 601b is created both with password 601.

Be sure to check to see if the room is already created by scrolling down past the media in game tab. You can close that tab if it becomes long by clicking on the "Media" tab. Delete the teacher601 if you want two teachers to exist on that door (i.e. teacher601a and teacher601b)
Once you scrolled down you can see which teachers exist via the Delete Users or the currentUrls tab. 

*if you delete say room601 in order to create room601a and room601b, you will not be deleting the images associated with the account. The account will be deleted meaning there will not exist a login with that user and also will not be a title on top of the door, but the images will still be visible to the admin and the admin may want to delete those images so as to not clog the listing in the admin view and also free up space for uploading other pictures. You can still add the titles to the door if you give room601a and/or room601b a title (both titles will show above the door)
